# NestJS
- NestJS is built on top of ExpressJS but adds structure, scalability, and TypeScript support out of the box. 
- It follows SOLID principles and uses decorators, modules, and dependency injection to make code more maintainable and testable. 
- Express is great for small apps, but NestJS shines in enterprise-grade applications.
