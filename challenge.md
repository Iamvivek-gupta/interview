# Servify Project Explanation


"In my last project, I worked in the insurance domain, focusing on developing device protection solutions for well-known B2B and B2C brands like Apple, RealMe, Xiaomi, and Samsung. The core of the project was to offer extended warranty plans for devices such as mobile phones and laptops.

Typically, when a user purchases a device, they will get a 1-year standard warranty. However, we created a system where users could purchase additional plans to extend their device warranties by 2-3 years or even 3-4 years, depending on the plan they chose.

If the user's device brand and model are present in our system, we create additional plans for the user. Once these additional plans are created and the user is active, they can raise a claim for physical or liquid damage to their device.

 
This involved integrating with various OEMs and streamlining the entire process, from selecting and purchasing a plan to managing claims when a user needed to file one.

The project was challenging yet rewarding as it required a deep understanding of both the technical and business aspects. I was responsible for designing and developing the backend systems that handled plan offerings, user management, and the claims process. We also ensured the system was scalable and could handle the needs of various brands, each with their own set of products and customer base.

This project not only allowed me to work with cutting-edge technology but also gave me the opportunity to directly impact the customer experience by making device protection more accessible and efficient. It was exciting to see how our solution helped users protect their valuable devices beyond the standard warranty period."



## 
my last project related to Insurance domain, working with many B2B and B2C brands like Apple, RealMe, Xiomi, Samsung, developed device protection solutions warranty by extending device warranty and streamline claim management systems. 

for example everyday users purchase mobile phone , laptop from different different brand like samsung apple realme xiomi, Nokia etc. same time user will get 1 year warranty. and we selling different different plans if user are interested they can purchase the plans in order to extend device warranty upto 2 - 3 years or 3-4 yers according to the plans they purchased.







# JWT Explanations



**Interviewer:** Can you tell me about your experience with authentication and authorization in Node.js, specifically using JWT?


**You:**

In my recent project, I was responsible for implementing both authentication and authorization in a Node.js and Express.js application. We chose JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication due to its stateless nature, which aligns well with our requirement for a scalable, microservices-based architecture.

**1. JWT Authentication:**

For the authentication process, I implemented JWT to securely transmit information between the client and server. Here’s how I approached it:

- **User Login:** When a user logs in, their credentials (username and password) are validated against our database. Upon successful validation, I generate a JWT using a secret key stored securely in our environment variables.
  
- **Token Payload:** The JWT payload typically contains the user’s ID and roles, which are crucial for the authorization process later on. I also include an expiration time to ensure tokens are only valid for a specific period, enhancing security.
  
- **Token Issuance:** The JWT is then sent back to the client, who includes it in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.

**2. Authorization Middleware:**

To handle authorization, I developed middleware that intercepts requests and verifies the JWT:

- **Token Verification:** The middleware first checks if the JWT is present in the Authorization header. If not, it immediately rejects the request with a 401 Unauthorized response.
  
- **Decoding the Token:** If the token is present, I decode it using the same secret key that was used to sign it. This step validates the token's integrity and ensures it hasn't been tampered with.
  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** After decoding, the middleware checks the user’s roles or permissions stored in the token payload against the route they are trying to access. If the user has the appropriate permissions, the request proceeds; otherwise, it’s blocked with a 403 Forbidden response.
  
- **Error Handling:** I also implemented comprehensive error handling within the middleware to gracefully manage scenarios like expired tokens, invalid tokens, or missing permissions, providing clear feedback to the client.

**Example Workflow:**

Let’s say we have a route to access user-specific data, like `/user/profile`. The middleware would:

- Verify the JWT.
- Decode the token to check if the user has a valid session.
- Ensure the user has the `user` role or specific permissions to access that profile data.

If everything checks out, the request proceeds to the controller to fetch the user profile. If not, an appropriate error is returned.

**3. Advantages and Best Practices:**

- **Security:** By using JWT, we avoid storing session data on the server, which minimizes the risk of session hijacking.
  
- **Scalability:** JWTs are stateless, making them ideal for distributed systems where we might have multiple instances of our service.
  
- **Best Practices:** I ensured to follow best practices such as short-lived tokens, rotating refresh tokens, and secure storage of the secret key.

This implementation provided a robust and secure mechanism for both authenticating users and authorizing access to different parts of the application, all while ensuring a smooth user experience.

---

**Interviewer:** That sounds comprehensive! Can you describe a challenge you faced while implementing this and how you resolved it?

---

**You:**

One challenge we encountered was managing token expiration. Users were getting logged out unexpectedly due to expired tokens, which was affecting the user experience.

To solve this, I implemented a refresh token mechanism. The refresh token has a longer lifespan and is stored securely on the client-side. When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token without re-authenticating. This allowed us to maintain security while improving user experience.

# Docubay Project explanation

previously one of my project, I also  worked in an OTT domain company called Docubay, which is a product-based company. Users can watch popular documentaries in their own country if they have a valid subscription. They can purchase monthly, quarterly, and half-yearly subscriptions. I was responsible for developing user modules to handle user sign-in, sign-up, forgot password, and reset password functionalities efficiently. Additionally, I was responsible for integrating Grabpay, a Singapore-based payment gateway, to handle one-time payments for user transactions and create user subscriptions.

To interact with users, I also integrated third-party services to manage notifications. For SMS notifications, I used Twilio, and for email notifications, I used SendGrid.

Use Cases of Notification Service:

Subscription Reminders: Notifying users about upcoming subscription renewals or expirations.
Payment Confirmations: Sending confirmation messages after successful transactions.
Promotional Offers: Informing users about special offers or discounts.
Account Alerts: Notifying users about changes to their account, such as password resets or suspicious activity.
Content Updates: Informing users about new documentaries or content added to the platform.






In my previous project at Docubay, an OTT domain company, I was responsible for integrating Grabpay, a Singapore-based payment gateway, to handle one-time payments for user transactions and create user subscriptions.

There is two type Payment Gateway :

One-time Payment Gateway: For example, if a monthly subscription plan costs ₹500, the user can pay ₹500 at once.
Subscription-based Payment Gateway: For instance, if a yearly plan costs ₹5000, users might prefer to pay in installments (EMI).
My Role: I integrated the Grabpay one-time payment gateway to manage user transactions and create subscriptions.

Technical Implementation:

API Communication: I used the Axios library in Node.js to communicate with the Grabpay transaction API.
Process Flow:
User Object: We pass the user object to the transaction API.
Validation: Once the details are validated, we receive a redirect URL in the response.
Redirect: The user clicks on the redirect URL and is taken to the Grabpay transaction page.
Payment Options: Users can choose from UPI, credit/debit card, and internet banking to purchase subscriptions.
Webhook Confirmation: After the payment is deducted from the user’s account, we receive a confirmation from the webhook API.
Subscription Creation: If the payment is successful, we create the user subscription in our database, allowing users to watch documentaries seamlessly.
Notification Integration:

SMS Notifications: Using Twilio.
Email Notifications: Using SendGrid.
Use Cases of Notification Service:

Subscription Reminders: Notifying users about upcoming renewals or expirations.
Payment Confirmations: Sending confirmation messages after successful transactions.
Promotional Offers: Informing users about special offers or discounts.
Account Alerts: Notifying users about changes to their account.
